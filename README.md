Overview
========

What is it?
--------------
This repository contais a Silex service provider which provides Apache Solr 4.* connectivity for Silex 1.2+, via the PHP Solr extension v2.

Installation
-------------
The preferred way to install Tree is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). For this, add `"bluem/silex-solr-provider": "~1.0"` to the requirements in your composer.json file. As this library uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org), you will get fixes and feature additions when running composer update, but not changes which break the API.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository using git or download a tagged release.
